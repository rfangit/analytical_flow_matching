# Analytical Flow Matching

This repository provides code and experiments utilizing the optimal solution to the flow-matching training objective. It serves as a reference for understanding and implementing analytical solutions in flow-matching tasks across various datasets.([Gist][1])

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

* **2D Examples/**: Demonstrations of flow-matching in two-dimensional settings. Contains work for arbitrary schedules, final variances, and a variety of toy two-dimensional problems.
* **CIFAR-10/**: Implementation with CIFAR-10 dataset.
* **Custom Dataset Example (Sine)/**: Example implementation for a custom dataset (a family of sine waves).
* **ImageNet/**: Implementation with ImageNet dataset.
* **MNIST/**: Implementation with MNIST dataset. This also contains a small flow-matching model trained on MNIST for comparison with the analytic results.
* **analytic\_flow\_funcs.py**: Functions implementing analytical flow-matching for arbitrary schedules and datasets.
* **image\_display\_funcs.py**: Utility functions for visualizing images and results.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of analytical solutions in flow-matching across different datasets. Visualizations are provided within each dataset's directory.

## ðŸ§ª Reproducing Experiments

To explore the experiments:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run notebooks**:

   Open any notebook under experiment directories (e.g., `MNIST/`, `CIFAR-10/`) to run the experiments interactively.
